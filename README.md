# JavaScript-Weekly-Project

Nothing much; just to get my hands dirty with JavaScript. The project
inspirations are from [Mikke Goes
Coding](https://mikkegoes.com/javascript-projects-for-beginners/).

### Overview

- Use `setInterval(func, interval)` to execute counting function that will
  increase a global count and update display. The interval set in `setInterval`
  will determine the "frame rate".
- Execute the counting function per 10 ms => 0.01 s, therefore, each function
  call will increase the count by 1.
- When the count reaches 100, set to 0, then increase the number of seconds by
  one.
- Use `clearInterval(ID)` to stop the repeated execution.
